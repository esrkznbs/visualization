# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.

This visualization about girls education across the world is balanced in terms of storytelling, clarity, and design principles. First, it uses progressive narrative structure. Information is introduced in sections such as global context, regional comparison, poverty and gender gaps, then specific education indicators. This reduces cognitive load and supports comprehension. Second, the design shows visual hierarchy. Headlines, section breaks, and consistent use of magenta to represent girls guide the viewer’s attention and reinforce meaning across charts. It looks cleanwith simpler visualization tools which helps with readability. Data sources are cited, and the charts allow viewers to see evidence behind the claims which increases credibility and readability for the viewer. Overall, this visualization is better at telling a story through data about gender and education inequality.

This UNICEF visualization- linked above- is data-rich but designed poorly, pmostly because of the high cognitive load, weak visual hierarchy, and less than ideal clarity. First, it overwhelms viewers with too many visual elements presented simultaneously. The choropleth map, multiple dot-strip plots, rankings, medians, and country comparisons all compete for attention. In terms of cognitive load as we discussed in lecture, this increases extraneous cognitive load because viewers spend more effort decoding the layout than understanding the data. Second, the dashboard lacks a clear information hierarchy. Effective visualizations guide the viewer through a narrative or structured path, but here all panels carry equal visual weight. The viewer does not know where to look first or how different elements relate or if there is a hierarchy of data. ANother thing is the color scheme which is ambigious. Blue and orange gradients appear to differentiate different values, but without clear directional explanation (e.g., whether darker means better or worse), interpretation becomes uncertain. This reduces perceptual accuracy. Overall, while the data may be substantively accurate, the visualization fails to communicate insights efficiently/

    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      The UNICEF visualization could be significantly improved by simplifying how information is presented and making the structure easier to follow. One important change would be to reduce visual clutter instead of showing many indicators at once, the dashboard could allow viewers to select and view fewer metrics at a time. This would lower cognitive load and make it easier to focus on meaningful patterns.The design would also benefit from a clearer visual hierarchy. Currently, all elements compete for attention. Using stronger differences in size, placement, and contrast could guide viewers from a broad overview to more detailed information in a more intuitive sequence.
Another improvement would be clarifying the color encoding. While color appears to represent value differences, it is not always clear whether darker shades indicate better or worse outcomes. Adding a clear, explanatory legend would make interpretation more immediate and reduce ambiguity. Finally, the layout should better support cognition over memory. Related comparisons should be placed side-by-side so viewers do not have to scan across multiple areas of the dashboard to connect information. This would make comparisons faster, easier, and more accurate.

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
